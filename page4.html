 <h1>Since you wanna know so bad</h1>

 <p> Step One: Procrastinate</p>
 <p> Why try to do any work right now? When you can do them later. Its ok
 you CAN do them Tomorrow. Or even After Tomorrow. Don't Stress yourself and
just wait until last minute to do all your work. So instead of 1 Assignment
each day you can do 7 at the end of the week. But if u feel lazy at the end of
the week. You can just do them Next week And double the work :)</p>

 <p> Step Two: Dont give your full effort</p>
 <p> yep. You heard it, Just try to do the bare minimum. Dont go for an A+
 go for a passing grade. Instead of writing every detail in that one story
you can just type 4 sentences if that is what is asked for.</p>
